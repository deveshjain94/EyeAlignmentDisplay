Hey all,

Project Goal : Build a self-alignment device using light field displays. The user should see an image/pattern on the screen only when this device is aligned correctly with the eye. 
This will aid in the Retina Imaging Device amongst other eye diagnosis devices which require perfect alignment of the device and user's eyes.

Short Term Goal:
Get a normal image to appear 3D on a mobile phone. This will be done by attaching a parallax barrier onto the screen of the mobile phone.

Individual Short Term Goals:
Devesh : 1. Generate image for the cell phone display
	 2. Perform simulations of how the above image looks on the retina

Dolly  : Create 3D CAD model for holding the phone and the assembly 	 together (I had a doubt here. Since we are only going to be 		 sticking stuff on the cell phone. What do we need a CAD model 	 	 for? Is it for fixing the distance between the eye and the  		 mobile?)

Amit   : 1. Remotely control the mobile phone since it will not be usable 	    once we put a parallax barrier on the s.creen.

Future Plans :
1. We might plan to use a simple LCD display with a microcontroller and simple I/O to give user feedback once an image is visible to freeze the alignment
2. New CAD designs will have to be made for this.
3. Microcontroller , LCD and I/O interfacing.

General guidelines : 
1. Follow Pushyami's mail for Documentation.
2. Donot be restricted to the task given to you. Everyone should know about everything being done in the project.
